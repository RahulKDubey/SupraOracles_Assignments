1.	Multi-Signature Wallet Structure:

The contract is designed as a multi-signature wallet where multiple owners collectively control the funds.

Owners are stored in an array, allowing for flexibility in the number of participants.


2.	Transaction Confirmation Mechanism:

A mapping (isConfirmed) is used to track confirmations for each owner and each transaction.

The confirmTransaction function handles confirmation logic and checks if the required number of confirmations is reached before executing a transaction.


3.	Transaction Structure:

Transactions are structured with the Transaction struct, including the destination address, value, and execution status.

The transactions array maintains a history of all submitted transactions.


4.	Modifiers for Function Access:

A onlyOwner modifier is implemented to restrict certain functions to be callable only by owners.

This adds an additional layer of security to ensure that critical functions, like executing transactions, can only be performed by authorized parties.


5.	Event Logging:

Events (TransactionSubmitted, TransactionConfirmed, and TransactionExecuted) are emitted for key contract actions. This allows external applications to monitor and react to changes on the blockchain.


6.	Initialization in Constructor:

The contract constructor initializes the owners and confirmation requirements based on the provided parameters. This ensures that the contract starts with the required configuration.


7.	Error Handling:

Various require statements are used for error checking, ensuring that inputs are valid and functions are called under the appropriate conditions.
