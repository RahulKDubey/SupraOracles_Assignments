1.	Initializing the Swap Contract:

	Test Case 1: Deploy the Swap contract with correct initial state

Input: Deployment parameters (Token A, Token B, Exchange Rate)
Expected Output: Contract is deployed with the correct initial state

	Test Case 2: Attempt to deploy with an invalid initial exchange rate

Input: Negative exchange rate
Expected Output: Revert - "Invalid initial exchange rate"


2.	Updating the Exchange Rate:

	Test Case 3: Owner updates the exchange rate successfully

Input: New exchange rate
Expected Output: RateUpdated event is emitted, and the exchange rate is updated

	Test Case 4: Non-owner attempts to update the exchange rate

Input: New exchange rate
Expected Output: Revert - "Only the owner can call this function"


3.	Swapping Tokens:

	Test Case 5: Swap Token A for Token B successfully

Input: Token A, Amount
Expected Output: Swapped event is emitted, and the tokens are exchanged correctly

	Test Case 6: Swap Token B for Token A successfully

Input: Token B, Amount
Expected Output: Swapped event is emitted, and the tokens are exchanged correctly

	Test Case 7: Attempt to swap with an invalid token address

Input: Invalid token address, Amount
Expected Output: Revert - "Invalid token address"

	Test Case 8: Attempt to swap with insufficient Token B balance

Input: Token A, Amount
Expected Output: Revert - "Insufficient Token B balance"
	Test Case 9: Attempt to swap with insufficient Token A balance

Input: Token B, Amount
Expected Output: Revert - "Insufficient Token A balance"


4.	Edge Cases:

	Test Case 10: Attempt to swap with zero amount

Input: Token A, 0
Expected Output: Revert - "Invalid amount"

	Test Case 11: Attempt to swap with the maximum uint256 amount

Input: Token B, max uint256
Expected Output: Swapped event is emitted, and the tokens are exchanged correctly

	Test Case 12: Attempt to swap with an invalid exchange rate (rate = 0)

Input: Token A, Amount
Expected Output: Revert - "Invalid exchange rate"
